                        of the reasons why Melbourne is has the most would be because, the area is the heart of Victoria and Melbourne (CBD) is the pplace where all different kinds
                        of people from all different sorts of culture and countries. If you were to create a restaurant in Victoria, Melbourne (CBD) will be the most competitive area to

                        popular industry would be the takeaway food services in every Area. Carlton is the second area with the most toal number of service types with a total of 2,442.
                        With the most famous industry, cafes and restaurants. Pubs, Taverns and Bars are the third most popular industry to be in, however, South Yarra and Port Melbourne does
                        not have any of them, so in that area, it is most recommended to open a bar since there is almost none that is recorded so far. Similar with East Melbourne, where there is only
                        one bar that is open in that area. As for the category others, it consists of fresh supermarkets, accomodation, and more. However, they are not as much as the top 3 which are 
                        Pubs, Restaurants and Takeaway food services.
